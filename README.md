Finishing up the react section of TOP -- _whoooop_. This one was fun, was able to effectively integrate multiple concepts such as React Testing, API integration, passing state effectively, and React Router!

### Objectives

- [x]  Create new react project
- [x]  Plan out components and how they will interact in 
- [x]  Begin making components and organizing the code
- [x]  Begin combining components and using `React Router` to switch between pages
- [x]  Effectively fetch data for the items and switch when new items are requested
- [x]  Figure out best place to hoist state, and effectively track items, and current cart
- [x]  Style pages and add UI loading screen between data fetches
- [x]  Actively test components as working through project
- [x]  Push final result!

### What I learned:
- Main concepts:
    - React Router
    - React Testing (library)
    - Hoisting state
    - API integration and managing data fetches

#### Differently:

- Pretty happy with the result, but ready to move on to Node.js ;)
